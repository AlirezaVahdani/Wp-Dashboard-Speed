# Wp-Dashboard-Speed
This lightweight plugin makes wordpress faster while working in WP-Dashboard ;) just Test it

I have used some function that can block external requests that makes wordpress slower

some of functions that is used :

1. Block external request to e.g yoast,elementro &...
2. Disable emoji
3. Disable WooCommerce Marketing Hub & Analytics Menu
4. Disable extensions menu WooCommerce
5. Disable WooCommerce dashboard status widget

for restoring changes to default configuration ,you can just disable the plugin :)

good luck
